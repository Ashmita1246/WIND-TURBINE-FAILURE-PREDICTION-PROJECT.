# WIND-TURBINE-FAILURE-PREDICTION-PROJECT.
This project uses a Random Forest Classifier to predict wind turbine failures based on a synthetic SCADA dataset. It analyzes features like wind speed, temperature, vibration, and power output to detect potential faults early. The model achieves around 87% accuracy and is integrated with Streamlit for live predictions.
